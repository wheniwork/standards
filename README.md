# Elliot's Sample Project For When I Work

This project requires Golang 1.10 and PostgreSQL 10. 

The database change scripts currently don't target a specific database instance, and I've just run them on the default `postgres` database instance. If you would like to change what database they are in, you will also need to update the connection string in `config.json` in the Site directory and `database_test_config.json` in the Database directory.

I've also kept track of what needs to be done for this project and some brief notes on how to go about doing that in Issues and Projects. 

I've setup Travis CI to make sure that everything works on a system that isn't my own. 

#### Build
```bash
go get -u github.com/ECourant/standards
cd {path to github.com/ECourant/standards}
go build -o timedemo
timedemo
```
Make sure that PostgreSQL is installed on your machine as well and is accepting connections.
You can update the config file `config.json` to match your database settings on your machine.

You can change the `listen_port` if you want, but I did hardcode the port into the web UI, so it will not work on other ports at this time.

You will also want to run `Create Database.sql` on your PostgreSQL instance before running the website. This file can be found in the Database directory.


# REST API Documentation

### As an employee, I want to know when I am working, by being able to see all of the shifts assigned to me.
One shift shows up in the response that does not have an employee, this is because the employee_id for that record is null, and will show up for all users.

### As a manager, I want to schedule my employees, by creating shifts for any employee.
Shifts can be created with a PUT or POST request to `/api/shifts`
If the creation was successful it will return the created object.
<details><summary>HTTP Request</summary>

```http request
POST /api/shifts?current_user_id=3
{
    "manager_id": 3,
    "employee_id": 1,
    "break": 0,
    "start_time": "Thu, Aug 1 19:31:46.631 2018",
    "end_time": "Thu, Aug 1 20:31:46.631 2018"
}



{
    "success": true,
    "results": {
        "id": 7,
        "manager_id": 3,
        "employee_id": 1,
        "break": 0,
        "start_time": "Wed, Aug 01 19:31:46.631 2018",
        "end_time": "Wed, Aug 01 20:31:46.631 2018",
        "created_at": "Sun, Aug 19 11:50:15.112 2018",
        "updated_at": "Sun, Aug 19 11:50:15.112 2018"
    }
}
```


If the creation was not successful, an error message will be returned. For example; if the start time comes after the end time.
```http request
POST /api/shifts?current_user_id=3
{
    "manager_id": 3,
    "employee_id": 1,
    "break": 0,
    "start_time": "Thu, Aug 3 19:31:46.631 2018",
    "end_time": "Thu, Aug 1 20:31:46.631 2018"
}



{
    "message": "Error, (start_time: Thu, Aug 3 19:31:46.631 2018) must come before (end_time: Thu, Aug 1 20:31:46.631 2018).",
    "success": false
}
```

Or if the shift time's conflict with another shift for that employee.
```http request
POST /api/shifts?current_user_id=3
{
    "manager_id": 3,
    "employee_id": 1,
    "break": 0,
    "start_time": "Thu, Aug 2 19:31:46.631 2018",
    "end_time": "Thu, Aug 2 20:31:46.631 2018"
}



{
    "message": "Error, 1 shift(s) already exist for user ID 1 during the start/end time. Conflicting shift(s): 7.",
    "success": false
}
```
</p>
</details>


### As a manager, I want to see the schedule, by listing shifts within a specific time period.
There are 4 url params that are used for this request: `date_from`, `date_to`, `date_time_from` and `date_time_to`
Only 1 from and 1 to are allowed per request. The `_time_` params will be converted to `timestamp` in SQL before filtering.
But the normal params will be filtered as `date`.

### As a manager, I want to be able to change a shift, by updating the time details.
When updating a shift, the only required information is the shift ID. Only the fields that are being changed need to be included in the request.
However; if a `manager_id` is not specified when updating a shift, the `current_user_id` will be set as the new `manager_id`.

### As a manager, I want to contact an employee, by seeing employee details.
`GET` requests should return the field `employee_user` which will include all of the user's details from the users table.

```http request
GET /api/shifts?current_user_id=3&date_from=2018-08-01&date_to=2018-08-06

{
    "success": true,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 7,
            "manager_id": 3,
            "manager_user": {
                "id": 3,
                "name": "Jenny",
                "phone": "1-800-867-5309",
                "role": "manager",
                "created_at": "Sun, Aug 19 11:57:32.489 2018",
                "updated_at": "Sun, Aug 19 11:57:32.489 2018"
            },
            "employee_id": 1,
            "employee_user": {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "Elliot",
                "email": "elliot@elliot.com",
                "role": "employee",
                "created_at": "Sun, Aug 19 11:57:32.489 2018",
                "updated_at": "Sun, Aug 19 11:57:32.489 2018"
            },
            "break": 0,
            "start_time": "Thu, Aug 02 19:31:46.631 2018",
            "end_time": "Thu, Aug 02 20:31:46.631 2018",
            "created_at": "Sun, Aug 19 11:57:32.618 2018",
            "updated_at": "Sun, Aug 19 11:57:32.618 2018"
        }
    ]
}
```

Or the users endpoint can be queried directly.
```http request
GET /api/users?current_user_id=3

{
    "success": true,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Elliot",
            "email": "elliot@elliot.com",
            "role": "employee",
            "created_at": "Sun, Aug 19 12:05:11.306 2018",
            "updated_at": "Sun, Aug 19 12:05:11.306 2018"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Jimmy",
            "email": "jimmy@johns.com",
            "role": "employee",
            "created_at": "Sun, Aug 19 12:05:11.306 2018",
            "updated_at": "Sun, Aug 19 12:05:11.306 2018"
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "Jenny",
            "phone": "1-800-867-5309",
            "role": "manager",
            "created_at": "Sun, Aug 19 12:05:11.306 2018",
            "updated_at": "Sun, Aug 19 12:05:11.306 2018"
        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "Henry",
            "phone": "1-800-123-4561",
            "role": "employee",

            "updated_at": "Sun, Aug 19 12:05:11.306 2018"
        }
    ]
}

# Notes
> I did create a small web app for a UI. But I didn't have enough time to build out all of the functionality from the user stories into the UI. It pretty much has everything except being able to see non-manager contact info, and being able to update the times of existing shifts. Other than that I believe all the functionality is there in the UI. You can access the ui by launching the application and going to `http://localhost:8080/`. 

> Currently the database is storing date/times in central daylight time. I struggled to come up with a good way to convert dates/times to RFC 2822 in Golang, so I opted to instead convert/format them in PostgreSQL. This means that all of the date/time fields are strings in Go but since no operation is being performed on the data itself there, this should be fine. I might change this later and add the formatting to the driver somehow instead? As long as it looks clean and wouldn't effect changes in the future.

> I've taken some code from one of my other website projects that I was working on in Go to make the REST API a bit easier when it came to filtering/sorting/selecting fields to be returned. And the date range handling for Issue #6 I added into that filtering handler.

> I had some issues with nil references in the shifts code. Kept running into this: https://golang.org/doc/faq#nil_error I was able to fix it but the code was so spaghetti I ended up discarding all of the changes because it also ended up introducing a bunch of other bugs. So the verifyShift section works but it's not as pretty as I'd like it to be.

> There are a few things I'd do differently. Given more time I think I would have handled dates and times differently. I think I would add some kind of custom serializer for when it actually encodes to JSON to convert the dates and times to RFC 2822 there. That way I'm not doing a ton of `to_char()` functions in SQL. I'd also choose a different framework for the Web UI; I found it incredibly difficult building time pickers in the UI that were easy to use, and the resulting pickers are not fantastic by any means.
