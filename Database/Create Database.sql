-- This view is insane.
-- For all of the shifts it looks at the expected hours to be worked.
-- If a shift were to go into another week, such as an overnight shift. Then the hours will be split into those two weeks.
-- If there is a break on a shift, it will be subtracted from the end of the shift. This way if the shift goes into the next week...
--    it will allocate hours from that next week first. This also makes it easier because if you take a one hour break on a shift...
--    that goes into the next week by one hour, it will not show on the next week. This isn't ideal, but without knowing clock in/out...
---   times for a shift (so a break could be determined) its hard to know when a break is.

-- Once a shift has been split, it also takes into account whether that shift is in the past or future, or is currently happening.
-- If a shift is currently happening, it will only indicate the hours worked until the current timestamp.
-- If a shift is in the future it will show 0 hours work, but will still show the hours scheduled.
-- If a shift is in the past it will assume that the start and end of the shift are essentially time clocks. So it'll calculate it as hours worked minus the break.
